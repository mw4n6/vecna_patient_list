# vecna_patient_list
Patient list app in conjunction with Vecna Technologies

In this next stage, we ask that you spend two to three days to complete a short project. This project should showcase your technical skills as well as your knowledge and interest in user experience design. Attached to this e-mail is a file, "patients.json". It contains an array of fictitious patients with randomly generated demographic data, including: 

- First Name 
- Last Name 
- SSN (last four digits) 
- Address 
- Primary Phone Number 
- Work Phone Number 
- Birth Date 

The attached html page is a blank canvas where you will create your application. Using any tools at your disposal, design a small front end application that consumes the patient data. 

Your app needs to include the following functionality: 

1) Display a list of patients 
2) Allow an end user to select a patient and edit the demographic data in a separate view 

When creating your application, consider Vecna's BREC philosophy: 

Beautiful - Study the context and the needs of various users and create functional beauty with usability as its core principle and a consistent visual design. 

Responsive - Be responsive to the context: device, display size, content, needs, expectations and experience. 

Ergonomic - Strive for fairness and attempt to design for all of us. Create interfaces useful for most, with and without disabilities and assistive needs. 

Configurable - This is the ability of the system to be manually configured for needs and outcomes, learn over time or use contextual defaults for a smart interface that is accessible, semantic, adaptable, responsive, agnostic, graceful, fast, secure and trustworthy. 

We will be looking for you to show off your understanding of a few core coding concepts as well. If you are familiar with a front end MVC framework like Backbone, Angular, or Ember, show us. Strut your CSS or SCSS skills. Use javascript modules if you know how. Throw in a build process like Gulp or Grunt if you have time. If you're a test-cases-first type of developer, use a testing framework like Jasmine, Mocha, or QUnit. If you don't have time for all of these, tell us what you would do if you did.
