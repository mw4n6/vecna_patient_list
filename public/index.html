   Welcome!

Thank you for your interest in a Front End Developer - UX position at Vecna. Upon reviewing your application, we invite you to enter the next stage of our hiring process.

In this next stage, we ask that you spend two to three days to complete a short project. This project should showcase your technical skills as well as your knowledge and interest in user experience design. Attached to this e-mail is a file, "patients.json". It contains an array of fictitious patients with randomly generated demographic data, including:

- First Name
- Last Name
- SSN (last four digits)
- Address
- Primary Phone Number
- Work Phone Number
- Birth Date

The attached html page is a blank canvas where you will create your application. Using any tools at your disposal, design a small front end application that consumes the patient data.

Your app needs to include the following functionality:

1) Display a list of patients
2) Allow an end user to select a patient and edit the demographic data in a separate view

When creating your application, consider Vecna's BREC philosophy:

Beautiful - Study the context and the needs of various users and create functional beauty with usability as its core principle and a consistent visual design.

Responsive - Be responsive to the context: device, display size, content, needs, expectations and experience.

Ergonomic - Strive for fairness and attempt to design for all of us. Create interfaces useful for most, with and without disabilities and assistive needs.

Configurable - This is the ability of the system to be manually configured for needs and outcomes, learn over time or use contextual defaults for a smart interface that is accessible, semantic, adaptable, responsive, agnostic, graceful, fast, secure and trustworthy.

The rest is up to you! When you are finished, zip your directory and email it to online-eval@vecna.com with your name. Given the limited time and scope of this project, we do not expect you to achieve everything that you might want to accomplish. Instead, along with your submission, please describe what you would do if you had more time and summarize your design and development processes along with the tools you chose to use.

We look forward to receiving your files, and you should hear from our office within one to two weeks of sending them to us as to the next steps in our process.

Sincerely,

Vecna Talent Team
